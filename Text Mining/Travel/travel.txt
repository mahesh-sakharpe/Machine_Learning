"2" "The hotel was really nice, the room clean and comfortable. The food was really good but sometime a little cold, little seasoning.  The bar tenders were super friendly and welcoming. But the overall experience was great especially Jose the entertainment chief. "
"3" "The hotel was good to be an all inclusive hotel. The bar was nice, the best Jose the Gomero one hehe. The food was good enough and the rooms were clean. But the most amazing department in this hotel was obviously the animation team all of them were working so hard everyday. The coolest one Jose and really hot I love you Jose !…"
"4" "Lots to love.  The location is superb. quick 10mins to the beach.  Lots of staff. check in and out was great.   Room: paid a bit more for the pool view.. this is deff money well spent.  Food: lots of it. Fair variety. The bbq was by far the best.  Drink: ok.. Beer and Prosecco   were great. Other drinks were very watery.. all fine though. Plenty available when ever it was needed.  Staff: were great and very helpful.  room: a bit tired and shabby. Cracked tiles and tired looking furniture. however, comfy and large.  Value: very very good.  All inclusive.. I think if we went back again, we would do room only or B&B. Drinks are so cheap in the supermarkets and there is just so many restaurants to choose from.  Dont get me wrong, the food is absolutely lovely. Just didn't want to leave the beach to come back for food that was fairly similar each day at the hotel.  …"

"7" "This review is a mixed bag, this hotel could be so much better with more attention to detail from staff. Definitely nowhere near a four star hotel. Might be pushing a 3!  On arrival as a group of 11 with 4 adults and 7 children ranging from 16 to 1 we found the one man on reception to be rather unhelpful. We had a late arrival and enquired about where we would be able to get some snacks after we dropped our luggage in the rooms and were given vague directions to the restaurant and our rooms, after returning to reception twice after a slow check in we were again only given vague directions and struggled to find our rooms and the restaurant where the snacks were, as you can imagine with a large group of tired children and adults this wasn’t a great start. On arrival to our rooms we immediately realised there were no travel cots for the two 1 year old babies.....so back to reception! We were then told only one travel cot was available for the night. We settled for this as we were all very tired but as we arrived back to our rooms the one travel cot was outside our door which was broken and had rips in the mattress and was very old and very well used, because we were so tired we decided not to head back to reception for the fifth time!   Waking up the morning after arrival we found the restaurant to be very nice and plenty of choices for food. We found the food to be very good and plentiful all the way through our holiday and snacks were always available, so can’t understand some of the reviews about poor food, although just make sure everything is cooked through properly as I found the staff were rushing to cook fast enough for demand.   Rooms: Very tired and old fashioned. Air con was intermittent and not very good. No sink apart from bathroom sink to clean babies bottles and sofa bed very wonky! Cleaning staff extremely rude, as an ex housekeeper myself in a large and small hotel the attitude from the housekeepers was not good. I explained to the housekeeper one day we didn’t want the room cleaned, just the bin taken away due to having nappies in (you only get one in the bathroom) and have her a tip, only to be replied to by a grunt and a huff and to be handed a letter asking us to remove personal belongings next time they cleaned??? Strange and rude.   Pools: Great although floors extremely slippy especially for young children, lots of loungers broken. No problems getting beds although the lifeguards seem to let certain people reserve loungers (mostly groups of youngish girls) also lifeguard doesn’t like anyone having any balls, inflatables or fun! I can understand some of this but he went over the top.   Animation staff try their absolute best and deserve the most credit out of any staff in the hotel.   Unfortunately we won’t return to this hotel but if they had more customer care and nicer rooms we would return. …"

We found the food to be very good and plentiful all the way through our holiday and snacks were always available, so can’t understand some of the reviews about poor food, although just make sure everything is cooked through properly as I found the staff were rushing to cook fast enough for demand.   Rooms: Very tired and old fashioned. Air con was intermittent and not very good. No sink apart from bathroom sink to clean babies bottles and sofa bed very wonky! Cleaning staff extremely rude, as an ex housekeeper myself in a large and small hotel the attitude from the housekeepers was not good. I explained to the housekeeper one day we didn’t want the room cleaned, just the bin taken away due to having nappies in (you only get one in the bathroom) and have her a tip, only to be replied to by a grunt and a huff and to be handed a letter asking us to remove personal belongings next time they cleaned??? Strange and rude.   Pools: Great although floors extremely slippy especially for young children, lots of loungers broken. No problems getting beds although the lifeguards seem to let certain people reserve loungers (mostly groups of youngish girls) also lifeguard doesn’t like anyone having any balls, inflatables or fun! I can understand some of this but he went over the top.   Animation staff try their absolute best and deserve the most credit out of any staff in the hotel.   Unfortunately we won’t return to this hotel but if they had more customer care and nicer rooms we would return. …"

"44" "Lots to love.  The location is superb. quick 10mins to the beach.  Lots of staff. check in and out was great.   Room: paid a bit more for the pool view.. this is deff money well spent.  Food: lots of it. Fair variety. The bbq was by far the best.  Drink: ok.. Beer and Prosecco   were great. Other drinks were very watery.. all fine though. Plenty available when ever it was needed.  Staff: were great and very helpful.  room: a bit tired and shabby. Cracked tiles and tired looking furniture. however, comfy and large.  Value: very very good.  All inclusive.. I think if we went back again, we would do room only or B&B. Drinks are so cheap in the supermarkets and there is just so many restaurants to choose from.  Dont get me wrong, the food is absolutely lovely. Just didn't want to leave the beach to come back for food that was fairly similar each day at the hotel.  …"

"47" "This review is a mixed bag, this hotel could be so much better with more attention to detail from staff. Definitely nowhere near a four star hotel. Might be pushing a 3!  On arrival as a group of 11 with 4 adults and 7 children ranging from 16 to 1 we found the one man on reception to be rather unhelpful. We had a late arrival and enquired about where we would be able to get some snacks after we dropped our luggage in the rooms and were given vague directions to the restaurant and our rooms, after returning to reception twice after a slow check in we were again only given vague directions and struggled to find our rooms and the restaurant where the snacks were, as you can imagine with a large group of tired children and adults this wasn’t a great start. On arrival to our rooms we immediately realised there were no travel cots for the two 1 year old babies.....so back to reception! We were then told only one travel cot was available for the night.

Food: lots of it. Fair variety. The bbq was by far the best.  Drink: ok.. Beer and Prosecco   were great. Other drinks were very watery.. all fine though. Plenty available when ever it was needed.  Staff: were great and very helpful.  room: a bit tired and shabby. Cracked tiles and tired looking furniture. however, comfy and large.  Value: very very good.  All inclusive.. I think if we went back again, we would do room only or B&B. Drinks are so cheap in the supermarkets and there is just so many restaurants to choose from.  Dont get me wrong, the food is absolutely lovely. Just didn't want to leave the beach to come back for food that was fairly similar each day at the hotel.  …"

"79" "This review is a mixed bag, this hotel could be so much better with more attention to detail from staff. Definitely nowhere near a four star hotel. Might be pushing a 3!  On arrival as a group of 11 with 4 adults and 7 children ranging from 16 to 1 we found the one man on reception to be rather unhelpful. We had a late arrival and enquired about where we would be able to get some snacks after we dropped our luggage in the rooms and were given vague directions to the restaurant and our rooms, after returning to reception twice after a slow check in we were again only given vague directions and struggled to find our rooms and the restaurant where the snacks were, as you can imagine with a large group of tired children and adults this wasn’t a great start. On arrival to our rooms we immediately realised there were no travel cots for the two 1 year old babies.....so back to reception! We were then told only one travel cot was available for the night. We settled for this as we were all very tired but as we arrived back to our rooms the one travel cot was outside our door which was broken and had rips in the mattress and was very old and very well used, because we were so tired we decided not to head back to reception for the fifth time!   Waking up the morning after arrival we found the restaurant to be very nice and plenty of choices for food. We found the food to be very good and plentiful all the way through our holiday and snacks were always available, so can’t understand some of the reviews about poor food, although just make sure everything is cooked through properly as I found the staff were rushing to cook fast enough for demand.   Rooms: Very tired and old fashioned. Air con was intermittent and not very good. No sink apart from bathroom sink to clean babies bottles and sofa bed very wonky! Cleaning staff extremely rude, as an ex housekeeper myself in a large and small hotel the attitude from the housekeepers was not good. I explained to the housekeeper one day we didn’t want the room cleaned, just the bin taken away due to having nappies in (you only get one in the bathroom) and have her a tip, only to be replied to by a grunt and a huff and to be handed a letter asking us to remove personal belongings next time they cleaned??? Strange and rude.   Pools: Great although floors extremely slippy especially for young children, lots of loungers broken. No problems getting beds although the lifeguards seem to let certain people reserve loungers (mostly groups of youngish girls) also lifeguard doesn’t like anyone having any balls, inflatables or fun! I can understand some of this but he went over the top.   Animation staff try their absolute best and deserve the most credit out of any staff in the hotel.   Unfortunately we won’t return to this hotel but if they had more customer care and nicer rooms we would return. …"
