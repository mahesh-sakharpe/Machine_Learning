1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed
2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike


Do the necessary transformations for input variables for getting better R^2 value for the model prepared.

Q1- Answer:

                   SLR Model ==> Multiple R-squared:  0.8968,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8882
